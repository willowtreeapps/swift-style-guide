This is a style guide, but let's please avoid overly emotional rhetoric.
There is no perfect style, though you may find your preferred style best.

If you dislike something, please elaborate on why.

If you find something difficult to read, please show examples and why you think
one version is clearer than another.

This styleguide is generated from the SwiftStyleGuide.playground file. All changes to
the guide should originate there. Before submitting a PR, please run the ```generate_readme```
script which will convert the playground into the README.md file used by github.
